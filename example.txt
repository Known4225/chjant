POWER 0 0 90 0 1 0 1 0 0 

comp, posxya, inputs, inputHandles

inputs are either 0 or 1
inputHandles start with 1 or 2, depending on how many inputs the component can take
the remaining two values are the indices in the component list that correspond to the wire inputs for the up to two inputs

so if component 1 is wired to component 2 (a not gate) then component 2's inputHandles would be 1 1 0

the second input of POWER is set to 1 if the POWER block is on, the output is only set to 1 if it is wired to something (?)
